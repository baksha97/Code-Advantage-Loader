# CodeAdvLoader_IntelliJ

During my time at CodeAdvantage, I noticed the repetition of lengthy tasks that students were required to do -almost everyday. 
In my free time, I decided to build a program to my the lives of my students and myself easier by using this quickly made Java Swing GUI with various libraries for file management. 
This executable file has then been used and installed on all of the company's computers so that the students and the teachers are seamlessly able to complete restoring and completing code from a repository to get to the most important part of the lessons -teaching programming concepts
# Features
	Import custom Java classes from the pre-lesson repositories into the Java Project with ease, taking into consideration the ages of the students and the time limitations. 

	Import custom files from folders containing student modifications into the Java project modding main (Forge Minecraft) for two different modding curricula.
